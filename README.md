# Pendulum
In this project I will try to simulate pendulums, including double pendulums.

There is still some major bugs and is not that interactive, this will be solved soon.

# Controls

Left and Right to add or subtract velocity from first bob.

(changing mass, lenght, gravity, friction and grabing pendulum to change angle coming soon)
